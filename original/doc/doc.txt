                What's MSA?
                -=-=-=-=-=-

        MSA is a new freeware x86 assembler. It supports all 8086
        instructions and most of the 80186/80286 instructions. It
        only supports flat binary output (.COM files). Written by
        a 14-year old Swedish programmer (that's why my english
        isn't very good)-:

        MSA is pretty fast, much faster than NASM, and the only file
        you'll need to build a program is MSA.COM (27 KB). It runs
        fine on my old 286.

        I wrote MSA in C, using Borland C++ 2.0, but I don't think
        it should be very hard to port to another compiler. The
        source code is not commented, not structured, so, it may
        be a little hard to read...

        I have not tested MSA in FreeDOS yet, but there should not
        be any difference between running MSA in a DOS box, real-mode
        MS-DOS or FreeDOS.


                System Requirements  :-)
                -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  -=-

        MSA had been tested on the following computer, and it runs just fine.

                Toshiba 3100
                ============

                CPU:    80286
                RAM:    640 KB
                HD:     10 MB
                OS:     Toshiba DOS 5.0
                Screen: Small B/W plasma screen

        Your HD will not be filled just by installing MSA...

                168 KB (full installation)
                27 KB (minimum installation)

        MSA comes with both a 8086 and a 80186+ executable.


                Using MSA
                -=-=-=-=-

        MSA is a command-line program, use your favourite editor to
        edit the source files. Here are a more detailed description
        of the different command-line options MSA supports. (These
        command-line options are case insensitive, like the rest of
        MSA.


        =============================================================

                -o              - Set output file

        Use: -ofile.com, -odisk.bin

        There can only be one output file per compile, if more than
        one output files are present, the last one will be used. If
        no output file is present, you'll see the built-in help screen.

        =============================================================

                -p              - Nr of times to pass the file(s)

        Use: -p3, -p1000

        This is an optional command. -p2 is used if you don't type
        anything else.

        =============================================================

                -s              - Set starting point

        Use: -s0, -s0x7c00

        This is an optional command, if you don't use this option,
        the standard DOS .COM starting point (0x100) is used.

        =============================================================

                -b              - Set buffer size

        Use: -b0x400, -b0x100

        This option changes the size of the output buffer kept in
        memory. Should be a value between 0x100 (256) and 0x4000
        (16 KB).

        =============================================================

                -m              - Set output level

        Use: -m0, -m1, -m2

        m0 means: "only report errors"
        m1 means: "only report errors and serious warnings"
        m2 means: "report all"


        All other commands, not beginning with '-' will be assumed
        to be input files.



                The syntax of MSA
                -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

        MSA:s syntax is similar to the syntax of NASM. I think every
        documented feature of MSA is supported by NASM, but this does
        _not_ mean that a NASM program always can be assebled by MSA.
        For example, MSA has no 32-bit support.

        Constants
        =========

        There are two ways of declaring constants in MSA.

        1.      ident   EQU     value
        2.      CONST   ident   value

        I recommend the first way, for compatibility with NASM.
        A constant value may use following operators:
                '+', '-', '*', '/' and '%'
        But NOT:
                '(' and ')'

        You may also use following constants:
                $ and $$
        (A non NASM-compatible synonyme for '$' is 'offset')

        $ is the offset (offset of output file + staring point)
        $$ is the starting point

        You may only define integer constants, NOT floating point
        or string constants.

        Examples of valid constants:

        data_start      EQU     $+0x100
        my_sweet        EQU     0x4*0x13
        lord            EQU     $$-0x80

        Labels, DB, DW and DD
        =====================


        In MSA, you define labels in the same way as you do in all
        programming languages,

label:

        where 'label' is the name of your label. There is another way to
        define a label, only used with DB, DW and DD. This command:

fname   DB      "filename.dat",0
idword  DW      0x51a0

        does the same thing as:

fname:  DB      "filename.dat",0
idword: DB      0x51a0


        DB can be used to declare strings and 8-bit values:

my_db   DB      "this is a string",1,2,3,0x10,0x20,0x30,14%3


        DW is used only to declare 16-bit variables:

my_dw   DW      0x2314,0x5214,0x5382,0x0000,4,1,6


        DD is used only to declare 32-bit variables:

my_dd   DD      0x23a36b14,0x552814,0x5ba4382,0x1000000,4,51,6


        Comments
        ========

        Ordninary assembler comments, one-line comments beginning with
        ';', are the only valid comments in MSA.


        Include
        =======

        Does the same thing as typing an extra input file in the command
        line (adds the file to the 'to do' list).

        Example:

        ; f1.asm

        mov     ax,1
        include "f2.asm"
        mov     ax,3

        =============================================================

        ; f2.asm

        mov     ax,2


        This code will generate following in NASM:

        mov     ax,1    ; from f1.asm
        mov     ax,2    ; from f2.asm
        mov     ax,3    ; from f1.asm

        , but MSA will assembler this:

        mov     ax,1    ; from f1.asm
        mov     ax,3    ; from f1.asm
        mov     ax,2    ; from f2.asm

        When MSA finds an 'include' directive, the file is placed as the
        last item if the 'to do' list, while NASM starts assembling the
        new file, and when that's done, it returns to the main file.
        If a file that is allready included in the 'to do' list in included
        again, nothing happends (to avoid cross-referencing).


        Space
        =====

        NASM will assemble this

        mov     ax, 3
        cmp     al, 2

        , but MSA says 'Syntax error'. Spaces aren't allowed everywhere
        in MSA. Not within identifiers, or between operands (like in the
        example above). Use this instead:

        mov     ax,3
        cmp     al,2


        Opcodes
        =======

        If you want to use the short opcodes for the 1-step
        bit shift/rotation instructions, you'll have to type:

        shl1    ax
        ror1    bl
        ...
